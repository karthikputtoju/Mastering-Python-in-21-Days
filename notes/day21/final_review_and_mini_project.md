# Day 21: Final Review and Mini Project

## Title: Final Review and Mini Project

### Topics Covered
- Review of Key Concepts
- Planning the Mini Project
- Implementing the Mini Project
- Testing the Mini Project

## Detailed Explanations

### Definition
The final review consolidates all the topics covered in the course, ensuring a solid understanding. The mini project involves applying the learned concepts to create a real-world application.

### Why it is Required
Reviewing key concepts reinforces understanding and retention. The mini project provides practical experience and demonstrates the ability to apply knowledge to solve real-world problems.

### How to Implement
1. **Review Notes**: Revisit the course material, key concepts, and important topics.
2. **Plan the Mini Project**: Define the project requirements, design the application, and outline the implementation steps.
3. **Implement the Project**: Build the application according to the design, focusing on correct implementation and functionality.
4. **Test the Project**: Write and execute tests to ensure the application works as expected and meets the requirements.

### Where to Use
- **Review**: Useful for exam preparation, interviews, or as a refresher.
- **Mini Project**: Can be included in a portfolio or as a showcase of skills.

```python
# Example project structure

# Example code for app.py
import requests
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/data')
def get_data():
    api_url = "https://api.example.com/data"
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return jsonify(response.json())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

# Example test in test_app.py
import pytest
from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_get_data(client):
    response = client.get('/data')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    json_data = response.get_json()
    assert "data" in json_data
```

## Example Code
```python
# app.py
import requests
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/data')
def get_data():
    api_url = "https://api.example.com/data"
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return jsonify(response.json())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

# test_app.py
import pytest
from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_get_data(client):
    response = client.get('/data')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    json_data = response.get_json()
    assert "data" in json_data
```

## Explanation Code Step by Step
1. Project Structure:

	- app.py: Contains the application code. Here, a Flask application with one endpoint /data fetches data from an external API.
	- test_app.py: Contains test cases for the application using pytest. Includes a fixture to create a test client and a test function to verify the /data endpoint.
2. Application Implementation:

	- Define a Flask route that interacts with an external API.
	- Use requests to make the API call and return the response as JSON.
3. Testing the Application:

	- Use pytest with Flask's test client to simulate requests to the application.
	- Write tests to check that the API returns the expected status code and data.
## Key Points to Remember
1. Reviewing Concepts: Reinforces understanding and retention of the material covered.
2. Planning the Project: Essential for defining requirements, designing the solution, and ensuring a structured approach.
3. Implementing the Project: Apply learned concepts in a real-world context, focusing on correct implementation and functionality.
4. Testing the Project: Ensures the reliability of the application and verifies that all components work as expected.

## Quick Summary
The final review helps consolidate knowledge, while the mini project provides practical experience. Proper planning, implementation, and testing are crucial for creating a successful project. Use the project as a demonstration of your skills and understanding of Python programming and API automation with pytest.

## Quiz
1. What are the key steps in planning a project?
2. How can you verify that an application is functioning correctly?
3. What role does testing play in the development process?

## Labs
1. Lab 21.1: Mini Project Planning & Implementation
	Objective: Plan and Implement a mini project that involves building a Flask application with multiple endpoints and testing it using pytest.
	Instructions:
	Define the requirements for the Flask application.
	Design the application architecture and plan the implementation stages.
	Write pytest tests for the application.
	Document the project, including setup instructions and usage.
	
	Note: Try some more mini and main projects to gain good knowledge & experience.
