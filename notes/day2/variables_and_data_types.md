# Day 2: Variables and Data Types

## Title: Variables and Data Types

### Topics Covered
- Variables
- Data Types
- Type Conversion
- Constants

## Detailed Explanations

### Definition
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values. They allow you to name and manipulate data within your program.
- **Data Types**: Define the type of data a variable holds, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

### Why it is Required
Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to programming. It allows you to perform operations on data and ensures that the data is handled correctly.

### How to Implement
1. **Creating Variables**: Variables are created by assigning a value to them using the `=` operator.
2. **Determining Data Types**: Use the `type()` function to determine the data type of a variable.

### Where to Use
Variables and data types are used in all aspects of programming, from performing basic arithmetic calculations to managing complex data structures.

## Syntax
```python
# Variable assignment
x = 5        # Integer
y = 3.14     # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
